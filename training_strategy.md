Here is the technical breakdown of the parameters for your final implementation:1. Vision Encoder (DINOv3 ViT-B)Architecture: ViT-B/16 (768-dimensional output).Preprocessing: Resize to 224x224 using Bicubic interpolation.Normalization: Use CLIP Mean [0.481, 0.457, 0.408] and Std [0.268, 0.261, 0.275].Projection: You must add a Linear Layer (768 $\rightarrow$ 512) at the end of the DINOv3 backbone to map its features into the CheXzero latent space.2. Text Encoder (CheXzero / OpenAI CLIP)Backbone: The distilled CLIP text transformer provided in the CheXzero repository.Context Length: 512 tokens.Note: Even though standard CLIP uses 77, CheXzero's code is hard-coded for 512 to handle the long "Impression" and "Findings" sections of MIMIC-CXR reports.Weights: Use the pretrained best_64.pt (or equivalent) checkpoint weights from their repo as your starting point.3.

Implementation ChecklistTokenizer: Ensure you are using the specific tokenizer from the CheXzero repo (it handles the 512-token limit and specific medical vocabulary better than the generic CLIP tokenizer).Dataset Logic: Ensure your __getitem__ method in your PyTorch Dataset returns a text tensor of shape (512,).Local Node Storage: Since you are on the CUBIC cluster, remember to use the $TMPDIR protocol for your data loading to handle the high throughput of the DINOv3 vision encoder.By maintaining the 512 context length and the CheXzero text encoder weights, you ensure that your "Medical Knowledge" branch remains consistent with the paper's findings, while your DINOv3 vision branch provides a more modern, high-resolution feature set.
